From Yorkshire, through the corridor of uncertainty and out from the pavilion into the outfield, ready to demonstrate its poor technique to all and sundry, comes yet another way to enjoy Boycott Bingo.

Best enjoyed whilst listening the dulcet tones of Geoffrey Boycott on Test Match Special. The Ashes series 2013.

As approved by Gary Sobers (not really).
